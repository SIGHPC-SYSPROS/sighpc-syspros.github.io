\section{Artifact Description Appendix: [Paper Title]}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

{\em If a paper has no artifact and submits this appendix, the authors only need to complete this abstract subsection and mention that the paper has no artifact.  This text is sufficient: \textbf{``This paper is not paired with an artifact.''}  Other subsections can be removed. In order to maintain consistency in naming conventions with the SC18 technical program, please consider the word "experiment" to be equivalent to "demonstration"}
